+ An immersive virtual reality platform for measuring construction workers' safety behaviours.

+ Given the hazardous nature of construction sites, it can be risky for researchers to observe workers' behaviour on-site, whereas it is also risky for workers to undertake certain tasks that may involve unsafe situations only for research purposes. As virtual reality allows a real life-like experience to take place, it can stimulate more natural behaviour responses from participants to increase ecological validity of experimental results. An Oculus Rift-based virtual reality platform is developed to provide a realistic representation of the construction workplace for assessing workers’ safety behaviour where the workers are immersed and led to perform natural behaviours.

+ The virtual reality platform was developed to enable life-like construction operation experience such as one-handed manipulation of small objects (e.g., bricks, cables, and ID card) and two-handed manipulation of objects with big volume (e.g., cardboard).
